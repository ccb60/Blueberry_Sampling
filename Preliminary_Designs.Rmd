# Load Libraries  
We are working here with spsurvey version 4.1.4, which was updated September
15th, 2020.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(spsurvey)
```

# Set Random Seed  
To allow repetition of sampling design.  If you run this code right before
generating a sample, the computer will generate the same sequence of random
numbers, and thus the same sample.  If you forget, you'll get another (also
perfectly valid) sample.
```{r}
set.seed(98765)
```

# Define a Simple Unstratified Design 
With a ten to one oversample.

The sample is not drawn with regard to the Inspector Region. Information on the
Inspector Region will be  added later in ArcGIS after the sample and oversample
are drawn.
```{r}
SimpleDesign <- list(None=list(panel=c(PanelOne=50),
                         seltype="Equal",
                         over=500))
```

# Generate the Spatial Sample  
## Generate Unique Filename
Since we are going to re-run this sometimes when output already exists, we want
to come up with a filename for the shapefile that won't conflict.
```{r}
fn <- tempfile(pattern = "Blubry23RandomSD",
               tmpdir = "GIS Source Files",
               fileext = "")
fn
```

## Run GRTS Sample
This code generates pages of warnings.  They are not important for our purposes,
so I suppressed them here in the Word Document.  If you run this file as an R
markdown document, you will see them, and can evaluate them yourself.
```{r warnings = FALSE}
SimpleSample <- grts(
         SimpleDesign,                   # as defined above
         DesignID="Pt",                  # Arbitrary string to start site codes
         SiteBegin=1001,                 # number of first sample location
         type.frame="area",              # Must be one of following: "finite",
                                         #    "linear", or "area". Depends on the
                                         #    dimensionality of the support.
         src.frame="shapefile",          # Type of source of geographic data
                                         #    defining the support. Can be
                                         #   "shapefile", "sf.object",
                                         #   "sp.object" or "att.frame"
         
         in.shape='GIS Source Files/Blubry23Final',    # path to shapefile
         
         maxlev=10,                      # maximum number of hierarchical levels to use
         
         out.shape=fn,       # name your output shapefile
)

```
# Check The Design  
```{r}
dsgnsum(SimpleSample)

```
